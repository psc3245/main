    <h3> Welcome to Fridge Wizard </h3>
    <p>Fridge Wizard is the premier pantry and fridge manager. 
        It will organize your food, allow you to create grocery lists and recipies, 
        and even see statistics about food consumption. 
        All this is brought to you by the up and coming programming, Buckets.</p>
    <p>Speaking of Buckets, he'd like to thank you for using the website.
        By using this site, you support a college kid on his grind 
        just trying to make it in a tough tech market.

    <h4>
        Here are some words of inspiration: 
    </h4>
    <p>        You can be good at anything you do regularly. Think about it:
        if you drive to work every day, you get really good. Sometimes you even allow
        your brain to turn off and just autopilot. And guess what? You make it to work!
        If you can do anything on a daily or almost daily basis, you will eventually be really good.
        Consistency is the only thing that really matters.</p>
    <p>I've been coding at least 5 times a week for the past few months and I'm getting
        pretty freakin electric on the keyboard. (Don't play wit ya boy). Anything you do 
        consistently, you can be the super good at. 
    </p>
    <h4>
        So go get on your grind! The time is now.
